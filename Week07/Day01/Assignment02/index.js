//Challenge: changing casing in Text:
//1.	Write a JavaScript program to transform a user's input name such that the first letter of the name is converted to uppercase, while the rest of the letters remain as they are. This transformation improves the formatting of names entered in various scenarios like forms, user interfaces, or databases.
//2.	If the name is all in uppercase, remain the first character as Uppercase and change the rest to lowercase. 

var yourName=prompt("Please enter your name !");
//write you code below




alert("Welcome "+yourName+" to my new software");
